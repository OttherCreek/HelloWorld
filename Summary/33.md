## Notes
`CONST` keyword is a kind of a fake keyword. It is a mechanism, that helps making the code look a little bit cleaner. It is a kind of promise, what you give, that something remains constant and is not going to change.

**Note:** You can bypass or brake the promise, but **you shouln't**.

`CONST` is used to declare non-variable variables like this
```c++
const int MAX_AGE=90;
```

### Bypass the const promise
One way to bypass the const promise is the following
```c++
const int MAX_AGE=90;
int* a = new int;
a=(int*) &MAX_AGE;
```
where the cast to `(int*)` is needed, because else we would get the following error:

But as already mentioned, the promise shouldn't be broken. This might lead to a crash because the compiler might tread the `const int MAX_AGE=90;` as read-only content.

## The `const` keyword used with pointers
Depending on the position of the `const` keyword in the declaration of a pointer variable, it has different meanings. It relates always to the part that it's placed before (either before the asterix or before the variable name).

One usage is the following:
```c++
const int* a = new int;
int const* a = new int; // they are both the same; significant is that the `const` keyword is before the asterix
```
This means that you can't modify the contents of the pointer but changing the pointer itself is still possible:
```c++
const int* a = new int;
int b = 23;
a = &b;   // works fine
*a = b; // would not work
```

Another usage is to change the position of `const` behind the asterix (`*`):
```c++
int* const a = new int;
```
This means that you can modify the contents of the pointer but changing the pointer itself isn't possible:
```c++
int* const a = new int;
int b = 23;
a = &b;   // would not work
*a = b; // works fine
```
A third possibility is to use the `const` keyword twice:
```c++
const int* const a = new int;
```
This means that you can't modify neither the pointer nor the data, which it points to. That's a kind of static use of pointers.

## The `const` keyword used with methods
(Only) in classes/structs a method can be marked with the `const` keyword:
```c++
class Entity {
private:
    int m_X, m_Y;
public:
    int getX() const {
      return m_X;
    }
}
```
This guarantees that the function `getX()` **won't** modify any class member variable.

**Note:** This makes sense for getter-functions.

If the variable `m_X` is a pointer, you have to change the code to:
```c++
class Entity {
private:
    int* m_X, m_Y;
public:
    const int* const getX() const {
      return m_X;
    }
}
```
The meaning of the different `const`s is:
1. `const` = the returned pointer can't be modified
2. `const` = the contents of the pointer can't be modified
3. `const` = the method doesn't modify the actual `Entity` class

**Note:** The line `int* m_X, m_Y;` makes only `m_X` to a pointer. If `m_Y` should be a pointer as well, you have to write `int* m_X, *m_Y;`.

**Note:** Always mark your methods as `const` if they don't actual modify the class or if they are not suppossed to modify the class.

If you need to change a variable inside a `const` function you can use the `mutable` keyword:
```c++
private: 
  int m_X, m_Y;
  mutable int var;
public:
  int getX() const{
    var = 2;
    return m_X;
  }
```
The `mutable` keyword allows methods which are `const` to modify the marked variable.

Passing an object by `const &` means that the object is `const`:
```c++
void printEntity(const Entity& e){
  std::cout << e.getX() << std::endl;
}
```
This means that `e` can't be modified. It can't be reassigned like so:
```c++
e = Entity();
```
This also means that if you want to call a function of `e`, this function has to guarantee, that it doesn't change the object.

**Wrong** example:
```c++
class Entity{
  int m_X, m_Y;
public:
  int getX(){
    return m_X;
  }
}

void printEntity(const Entity& e){
  std::cout << e.getX() << std::endl; // this wouldn't work because the function getX() doesn't guarantee that it won't change the object e
}

int main(){
  Entity
}
```

**Right** example:
```c++
class Entity{
  int m_X, m_Y;
public:
  int getX() const {
    return m_X;
  }
}

void printEntity(const Entity& e){
  std::cout << e.getX() << std::endl; // this would work because the function getX() does guarantee that it won't change the object e
}

int main(){
  Entity
}
```

It's possible to have a duplicated version of the `getX()` method - one with `const` and one without:

```c++
class Entity{
  int m_X, m_Y;
public:
  int getX() const{
    return m_X;
  }
  int getX(){
    return m_X;
  }
}
```

**Note:** Always mark your methods as `const` if they don't modify your class or if they aren't supposed to modify your class.
